There is only one way and that is your way.
There is only one salvation and that is your salvation.
What is to come will be created in you and from you.
Don't compare. Don't measure. No other way is like yours.
There is only one way and that is your way.
You must fulfill the way that is in you.
breathe fire from your mouth and fingertips
recognize your madness
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I.
do things you want
do cool things
